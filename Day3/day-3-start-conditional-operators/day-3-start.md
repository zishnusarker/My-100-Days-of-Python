# Conditional Statement 

Like, if we need to have a condition inside our code, then we need to reach our output according to the condition .

Ex. Suppose there is a bowl where the water level needs to be at 80 cm but can not be overflowed. So , we need to drain water when it reaches 80 cm otherwise it will be overflowed. So, we need to give conditions when we will reach the targer , we till drain the water . 

Concepts like this make conditions . there comes if else , elif.

Here we i try to find out a person is allowed to ride a rollercoaster or not according to their heights
