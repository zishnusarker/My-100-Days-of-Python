## Rock Paper Scissors

# Instructions

Make a rock, paper, scissors game. 

Start the game by asking the player:

*"What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors."*

From there we will need to figure out: 
* How we will store the user's input.
* How we will generate a random choice for the computer.
* How we will compare the user's and the computer's choice to determine the winner (or a draw).
* And we how you will give feedback to the player.
